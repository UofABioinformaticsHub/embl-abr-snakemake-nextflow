# Introduction

## The Snakemake/NF way

Map, riders, roads, destinations - how the routes are defined

* Detailed backwards mapping
* Free flow + occasional signposts

## Practical example

### Bash script:

* Index a reference
* Align multiple samples (for loop)
* Merge BAM files

### Modified Bash script with HPC submission

What if alignment fails for sample X? Re-run everything?
